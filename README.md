| 5 | 1  | Mar 2035 | 1 | gatecrasher | failed | easy | - | - | - | - | 1 | - | missed an 86% on a flanked officer to get hit by the last trooper. the first 45% shot almost never fails. freaking bad luck. | - |

|   | 4  |          | 2 | retaliation | excellent | easy | - | loot + increased regional income | 9 | assassin | 1 | - | unvoidable hit from the assassin, even when we've spotted her ahead but she's got agile as well which makes her really painful to kill | - |

| 3 | 1  | Mar 2035 | 1 | gatecrasher | failed | easy | - | - | - | - | 1 | - | beaglerush effect; the only soldier that could see the pod patroling was put on overwatch by mistake, instead of shooting | avoid letting pods flank soldiers whilst concealed |
|   |    |          |   | gatecrasher | failed | easy | - | - | - | - | 1 | - | officer pod run against overwatch (even with elevation only one shot hit. on our turn, rolled min damage on one flanked trooper, left with a hard choice between activating the sectoid pod or rending the only non flanked trooper, used volt instead and hoped for the trooper to run away, but it instead shot for 45% and hit | - |
|   |    |          |   | gatecrasher | failed | easy | - | - | - | - | 1 | - | had to activate officer pod this time, could not leave two troopers up after min damaging one. templar rended the full health trooper (volt not available) and activated sectoid pod. one of the two troopers shot for 45% and hit | - |
|   |    |          |   | gatecrasher | failed | easy | - | - | - | - | - | 1 | was able to get the officer pod to run the overwatch but the only shot missed, on my turn needed 4 shots to kill the officer and activated the sectoid pod which was 2 tiles behind. the troopers hit two of their 3 45% and killed a soldier | - |
|   |    |          |   | gatecrasher | failed | easy | - | - | - | - | 1 | - | keep rolling min damage on troopers that will go and shoot someone. unfortunately there's not much that can be done. high ground is mandatory to land any shots reliably and they cannot roll min damage more than once or we risk getting shot and wounded | - |
|   |    |          |   | gatecrasher | failed | easy | - | - | - | - | 1 | - | this time both sectoid and officer pods walked into overwatch but by the time the second pod arrived we were out of shots (only one landed anyway). left with 3 troopers, the officer and a sectoid. killed all but one trooper and the sectoid. the trooper shot my templar. i'm going to change the way i start the mission as it's clear that the sectoid and officer pods are too close to each other for me to be able to do this mission without having soldiers wounded | - |
|   |    |          |   | gatecrasher | failed | easy | - | - | - | - | 1 | - | run across civies again. frustration is starting to creep in and i'm dashing soldiers without taking enough care about civies being on the way. a pod activated and we got shot | - |
|   |    |          |   | gatecrasher | failed | easy | - | - | - | - | 1 | - | another run over a tile from a hidden civie which triggered a pod, yada yada yada, we know the drill | - |
|   |    |          |   | gatecrasher | flawless | easy | - | - | 8 | - | - | - | felt like save scumming tbh, given the amount of restarts. Had to walk away from the officer pod and grenade one trooper on high ground and use another grenade on trooper + officer (killing the officer) and wounded the 2nd trooper. was able to hit a flanking shot and move my templar closer to the sectoid pod which activated on the next turn but were easy peasy to kill | - |
|   |  2 |         |   | neutralise field commander | excellent | easy | the lost | engineer | 56 | 2 | - | - | lost concealment to the lost because of bad positioning. templar mind controlled with flagbang too far way (flag banged templar instead). got hit by a 25 and a 45 from a trooper and the commander | unlucky as the templar won't be able to go to mission 4 which puts the whole campaign at risk |
|   |  3 |         |   | gather survivors | flawless | easy | the lost | scientist + intel + 2 grenadiers | 247 | - | - | - | - | - |
|   |  4 |         | 2 | retaliation | fair | easy | - | loot | - | - | 2 | 2 | killed the chosen whilst another pod walking into us, got shot once. was able to get rid of the first pod but activated the second pod which we manage to survive the first round of shots by offering easier shots to full health soldiers. rolled min damage on a trooper but what killed us was a faceless that activated after the first pod was dead which crited our ranger for 6. unlucky with the shots as advent crited 4 out of 5 shots against us. the second faceless got reflex and the grenadier wasn't able to run away fast enough and died | check extended information as the mod for enemy perks adds quite a lot of perks to standard units |
